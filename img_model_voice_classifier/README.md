# Image model voice audio classifier

This notebook generates spectrograms of aiff files generated by the `say` command on macOS using different voices.
It then trains a model on these spectrograms so that it can classify which voice produced a given spectrogram image.

Most of the code is LLM generated.
Because of this approach, the code may be suboptimal or buggy.
I didn't check it too carefully and it accomplished the job I set out to do.

I run my notebooks in VS Code/Cursor, so before I get started I run

```sh
python -m venv .venv
```

then select that as my notebook Kernel.
Then I install the notebook dependencies.

```sh
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install fastai librosa
```
